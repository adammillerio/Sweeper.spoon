--- === Sweeper ===
---
--- Automatically hide apps that are out of focus.
---
--- Download: https://github.com/adammillerio/Spoons/raw/main/Spoons/Sweeper.spoon.zip
---
--- This uses a hs.window.filter to detect windows that have gone out of focus. Then,
--- if they are configured to be "swept" in the apps config, they will be automatically
--- hidden if they remain out of focus after sweepCheckInterval (default 15 seconds).
---
--- Example Usage (Using [SpoonInstall](https://zzamboni.org/post/using-spoons-in-hammerspoon/)):
--- spoon.SpoonInstall:andUse(
---   "Sweeper",
---   {
---     start = true
---   }
--- )

--- Sweeper.apps
--- Variable
--- Table containing each application's name and it's desired configuration. The
--- key of each entry is the name of the application, and the value is a
--- configuration table with the following entries:
---  * sweep - If true, this application will be swept.
---  * sweepCheckInterval - Override time in seconds for global `Sweeper.sweepCheckInterval`.

--- Sweeper.sweepCheckInterval
--- Variable
--- Time in seconds to wait after a window loses focus to check if it should be swept.

--- Sweeper.logger
--- Variable
--- Logger object used within the Spoon. Can be accessed to set the default log
--- level for the messages coming from the Spoon.

--- Sweeper.logLevel
--- Variable
--- Sweeper specific log level override, see hs.logger.setLogLevel for options.

--- Sweeper.windowFilter
--- Main hs.window.filter. This is what is used to detect and action on unfocused
--- windows. It is a copy of the "default" window filter with Sweeper specific
--- sort order and callback configurations applied in the start method.

--- Sweeper.subscribedFunctions
--- Variable
--- Table containing all subscribed instance callbacks for the window filter, used
